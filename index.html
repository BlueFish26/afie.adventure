       <p>1.) Owls are the primary means of communication between wizards in Harry's world. However, in many parts of the world, owls are considered bad luck and harbingers of death.</p>
       <p>2.) Colors play an important role in the Harry Potter novels. For example, shades of red represent goodness, such as Gryffindor's scarlet robes, Harry's red ink, and the crimson Hogwarts Express train. The Weasleys have red hair and a red roof. Green is largely associated with negative events, such as when Harry sees a flash of green when his parents die and the green-colored curse that made Ron vomit.</p>
      <p>3.) Rubeus Hagrid, one of Harry's closest friends, is part wizard and part giant. Rubeus is Latin for something produced from a bramble or a thicket, which fits Rowling's description of him as "wild." Hagrid most likely comes from the term "haggard" which also means "wild" or "unruly."</p>
      <p>4.) Harry Potter's name may refer to a "potter's field," which is a cemetery in which people of unknown identity or the very poor are buried. This would be fitting because Harry Potter serves as a type of "everyman," a powerful mythological archetype.</p>

      <p>8.) The director of The Prisoner of Azkaban asked Emma Watson, Daniel Radcliffe, and Rupert Grint to write essays from the point of view of the characters. Watson wrote a 10-page essay, Radcliffe wrote one page, and Grint didn't turn anything in at all.</p>
        <p>9.) The original title of the first book was Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone and appeared on books in the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and other territories. It was changed to Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone by the American publisher because "Sorcerer's" seemed more exciting. Rowling later said she would have fought this decision had she been in a better position.</p>
      <p>10.) Both Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint admitted that they had a crush on Emma Watson in earlier films.</p>
       <p>11.) Harry's godfather's name, Sirius Black, comes from the name of one of the brightest stars in the sky, the "Dog Star" or Sirius (from the Greek word seirios, meaning "burning"). The star is a symbol of the goddess Isis and was central to the religion and philosophy of Egypt.</p>
       <p>12.) The curse used to kill Harry's parents, "Avada Kedavra," derives from a phrase in Aramaic Abhadda kedhabhra, which means to "disappear like this word." It was used to make illness disappear, but there's no proof it was meant to kill anyone. It is also likely the origin of abracadabra, which was used by doctors to cure fevers.</p>
