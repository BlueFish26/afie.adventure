<p>Ok, so one of my ideas for my manuscript, is that Emma, Ayesha and Casy find out that someone has stolen their school's legacy, a 24-carat diamond bracelet that has jewels encrusted within it, it became their school's legacy, because of a miracle, the school's foundress, Ms. Zenith was accidentally locked in her bedroom, and then took her diamond bracelet, and tried to use it to open the door, to her suprise, it had actually worked! She got free from her room and vowed that she would help others in need, as of course, a principal and foundress of Zeyla's School Of Peace.
Now that the precious bracelet was stolen, there would be chaos at school, nobody would be safe, Zeyla certainly wouldn't want this to happen. And, here we are. The trio solved the mystery!(But not yet tho)</p>

<p>A whole new idea, a whole new story! My other idea is that there is a ceremony at the beautiful city of Carpe Diem, called Seize Noctem, the citizens of Carpe Diem are the Stellas! Their original ruler was Emperess Stella. From then on, these fairies were addressed as the Stellas of Vera, Empress Stella's good and kind reign lasted 14 years, she then appointed someone, according to their rules, before her coronation, she would promise someone that she would appoint them when her reign came to an abrupt end. These were the laws that were stated when they gained independence, that was 1 year before Stella came to the throne, yet she broke the rules. She promised her eldest and most responsible daughter, Xandria, that she would come to the throne when her reign ended. But when the day came, Stella appointed Terra, the fairy who could manipulate minds, and Stella's 3rd daughter. There was Xandria, Naomi and Terra. She was the prophesied one who would be the second one in line to the throne. The witch fairies also prophesied Xandria's anger and sadness when this happened. After Terra was crowned, Xandria approached her, the wicked manipulating monster who took her crown, her crown!</p>
