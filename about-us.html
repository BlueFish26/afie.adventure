<h2>My Favorite Stuff!</h2>
<li>I really love books, and that's why I had a book review video!</li>
<li>I also like notebooks, because I can put my ideas and plans in life in a notebook, unlike a phone, I should admit it's a bit less private, since you can download a "diary," except that it's less personal, well points for more stuff.</li>
<li>I like school books and when I get them before school, I read it, that way I already know some of the answers in quizzes. And that's advice for school too!</li>

	<h2>My interests!</h2>
	<h5>No, not the money one, the things I like! Ok!</h5>
	<li>I aspire to be a famous, well-known author of a hit book series! The other dream jobs I can have is be a programmer (after all I did make an amazing website, am I right?), an artist, a model, or director. I'd like all of them, but that would become a very aggresive schedule, and I do not want that!</li>

		<h2>Wanna know my Patronus?</h2>
		<h3>My Pottermore stuff!</h3>
		<li>Rowena Ravenclaw for the win!</li>
		<li>Redwood wood with a Unicorn core hair 14 1/2" and QuiteBendy flexibility.</li>

		<p>Do you have a favorite characters from movies or books??? I'm a bit biased towards Luna Lovegood and Hermione Granger! I'm really annoyed and upset by the fact Hogwarts only accepts British or Irish witches or wizards... Hmphh!!!! Maybe if I try speaking like a British day girl or something...</p>

		<h2>Tips on making cool short stories!</h2>
		<ul>
		<li>
		Add suspense, suspense makes the setting of the story eerie and draws attention and a bit of fear... 
	  </li>
     	<li>
     	Add comedy too! Hilarious things always attract people.
      </li>
     	<li>
     	    Since there's already drama and comedy, what about some action too? To some it may seem serious, but look at drama it's way more serious</li>
     	<li>
     	    Be persevering if you wanna reach a goal, like J.K Rowling! She had to ask dozens of publishers before she got the book published. Now she's a billionaire!
       </li>
     </ul>

        <h2>Tips on interesting plots!</h2>
     	<li>
 		First things first. Make it gooood = amazing! ! ! My point is that the plot has to be understandable, not like "OMG, my BFF is the theif?!"
 		Well, sometimes that can happen. BUT, it should explain how that happened or how the character turned out to be that way!
 	</li>
 	<li>
 		Next, make it... confusing... or, aha! Make it "un-obvious" 'cause, I've seen stories with such obvious plots and plot-holes alike! Unique stories get more attention and more people will really like it much more than those copycat stories, right?
 		What I mean is that be yourself!
